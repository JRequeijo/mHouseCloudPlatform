<h1 class="page-header">Home Server HTTP RESTful API:</h1>
<p>This API is a RESTful API over HTTP which can be accessed on the Home Server. 
It is mainly used by the Online Cloud to access resources on the Home Server but it 
is accessible to any client which wants to access the resources and supports the HTTP 
protocol.</p>

<p>Note: This API is made available with the HTTP-CoAP Proxy which runs in the Home Server.
Thus note that every call to this API will issue a semantic similar call to the CoAP server
using the CoAP protocol and translating the corresponding response from CoAP to HTTP.
